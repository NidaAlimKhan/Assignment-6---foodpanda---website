                                <p>If you choose delivery, a foodpanda rider will collect your order from the restaurant
                                    and take it to your
                                    chosen delivery address. If you choose Pick-Up, you can takeaway your food directly
                                    from the restaurant
                                    for extra savings – and to jump to the front of the queue. Pick-Up orders are
                                    available for restaurants
                                    only.</p>
